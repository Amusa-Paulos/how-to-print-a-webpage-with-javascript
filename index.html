            HISTORY: Javascript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 and became the most popular language 
            for web development. It is used by every major website and application. It is a very powerful 
            language and is used by many large companies such as Google, Facebook, and Yahoo!
            It became ECMA standard in 1999 and is now called the ECMAScript standard. ECMA-262 is the 
            official standard for the language.

                What is JavaScript? JavaScript is primarily a client-side language. JavaScript started at Netscape, 
                a web browser developed in the 1990s. A webpage can contain embedded JavaScript, which executes when 
                a user visits the page. The language was created to allow web developers to embed executable code on 
                their webpages, so that they could make their webpages interactive, or perform simple tasks. 
                Today, browser scripting remains the main use-case of JavaScript. 
                <br><br>
                JavaScript’s syntax is inspired by C++ and Java. If you have experience in C++ or Java, 
                JavaScript’s syntax will seem familiar to you.
                <br><br>
                JavaScript is named after Java, and many ideas are borrowed from the Java language. 
                Other than that, Java and JavaScript are two entirely distinct languages

                you can use JavaScript to create interactive webpages.
